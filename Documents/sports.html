    <h1> Wrestling</h1>
    <p>     I started playing sports competitively at 13, when I signed up for the wrestling team with a few of my friends.
        I ended up wrestling for St. John’s for the next 6 years, and had a ton of laughs, learned
        countless lessons, and perfected a strenuous work ethic and unyielding desire to win.
        Unlike other sports where your teammates have the ability to affect the outcome of the game, wrestling on the mat
        allows you to dictate your own destiny. The harder you train, the better you can be; you alone control your success. 
        When you lose, you have no one to blame but yourself. When you win, you can be genuinely proud of the work you’ve done.
        The mat is my contentment because, along with some amazing coaches, it has taught me how to be a man. I have learned self-control,
        self-reliance, discipline, respect, and independence on that mat; it has been a unique and necessary classroom in its own right.
